# Simon-Game
 The Simon game is a classic memory game where players need to remember and replicate increasingly complex sequence. This project is a web-based version of the game, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
# Additional Gameplay Instructions
Starting the Game: Players begin by pressing the "Start" button, which triggers the first sequence.
Repeating the Sequence: After the game shows the sequence, players must click the colored buttons in the correct order.
Visual Cues: Buttons flash when clicked, providing visual confirmation of the player's action.
Game Over: If a player clicks the wrong button, the game plays a "wrong" sound, displays a "Game Over" message, and provides an option to restart the game.
